<meta name="description" content="Famous Garage Door Height For Boat Modern Ideas, Most of the boats i am looking at have maximum height specs in the 6�10 to over 7� range. The cost of a 9/10ft.
Garage door height From offshoreonly.com
My current garage door is 6�11. A traditional 2 car garage will fit a boat and trailer that is 26 ½ feet long diagonally across both spots. The majority of the garage plans with boat storage in this collection feature at least one bay that is 28’ deep, nicely handling a boat and trailer. Here was my logic, to build a garage with a 10 foot wide door (pontoon 8 ft) and 32 foot long, i figured it was a lot cehaper to once every 5 or 6 years have a vinyl shop make me a full cover to store the boat outside and keep the weather off.

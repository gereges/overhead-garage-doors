Guardian GUAT307 Garage Door Opener Motor From northshorecommercialdoor.com
My wife pushed the door opener a few more times, but the door wouldn�t move despite the motor responding. If the motor keeps running when the door is fully closed or fully open, first adjust the travel limits, following the instructions in the owner�s manual. Check the photo sensors� alignment (tip #1 above) or the cables to see if they�re broken or if the tension is off (#4). I just replace the gear and sprocket assembly but when the power was reconnected the motor just kept on running even when the limit was closed.

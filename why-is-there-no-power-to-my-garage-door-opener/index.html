<p>The green light on the garage door sensor indicates there is no problem with the power supply, and when it does not light up, it means there is a connection problem to the power source. I have never seen an opener just stop working like this on its own. If the garage door wonât open using the wall console and the remote control, most likely that the problem is with the garage door opener itself. My power went out and my garage door wonï¿½t open.
